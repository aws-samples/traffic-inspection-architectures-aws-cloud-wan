# East/West traffic (Single-hop inspection)

In the example in this repository, the following matrix is used to determine which inspection VPC is used for traffic inspection:

| *AWS Region*       | us-east-1 | eu-west-1 | eu-west-2      | ap-south-east-2 |
| --------------     |:---------:| ---------:| --------------:| ---------------:|
| **us-east-1**      | us-east-1 | us-east-1 | us-east-1      | us-east-1       |
| **eu-west-1**      | us-east-1 | eu-west-1 | eu-west-1      | eu-west-1       | 
| **eu-west-2**      | us-east-1 | eu-west-1 | eu-west-1      | ap-southeast-2  |
| **ap-southeast-2** | us-east-1 | eu-west-1 | ap-southeast-2 | ap-southeast-2  |

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed

## Code Principles:
- Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage
- Clone the repository
- (Optional) Edit the variables.tf file in the project root directory - if you want to test with different parameters.
- Deploy the resources using `terraform apply`.
- Remember to clean up resoures once you are done by using `terraform destroy`.

**Note** EC2 instances, VPC endpoints, and AWS Network Firewall endpoints will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for each VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.
